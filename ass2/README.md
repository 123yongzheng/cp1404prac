1. How long did the entire project (assignment 2) take you?
It took about 26 hours
2. What are you most satisfied with?
My favorite part is writing py in code

3. What are you least satisfied with?
kivy didn't learn well, so that's what I'm not satisfied with
4. What worked well in your development process?
A development process that has a clear plan, breaks down tasks into smaller manageable units, makes use of version control (like Git), tests code incrementally, and seeks feedback works well during development. Checking and refactoring code regularly also helps maintain code quality.

5. What about your process could be improved the next time you do a project like this?
This process can be improved by conducting regular code reviews, following established software development best practices, incorporating automated testing, documenting code and features, and seeking feedback from peers or mentors

6. Describe what learning resources you used and how you used them.
The learning resources used may vary depending on individual preferences and needs. Some common resources for learning Python and Kivy include online tutorials, documentation, video courses, forums, and question and answer platforms

7. Describe the main challenges or obstacles you faced and how you overcame them.
The main challenges or obstacles may vary from project to project and individual situation. Some common challenges in project development include understanding the requirements and designing the application structure

8. Briefly describe your experience using classes and if/how they improved your code.
Classes in object-oriented programming provide a way to organize code and encapsulate related data and functionality. They allow the creation of reusable and modular code components, enhancing the organization and readability of code
