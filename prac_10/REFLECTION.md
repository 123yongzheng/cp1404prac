## Estimates for Practical Tasks
With regard to my estimates of actual tasks, my accuracy depends on the complexity and familiarity of the tasks. 
Initially, I was faced with the challenge of accurately estimating how long certain tasks would take, but as I gained experience throughout the topic, my accuracy improved. 
The more I practiced and learned from previous tasks, the better I was able to estimate the time and effort required for similar tasks in the future.
## Code Reviews
When it comes to code reviews, I've learned valuable lessons from being reviewed and doing the reviews myself. 
As the recipient of code reviews, I understand the importance of writing clean, readable, and maintainable code. 
Constructive feedback from reviewers enabled me to identify areas for improvement and learn alternative approaches. 
On the other hand, when conducting code reviews, I realized the importance of providing actionable and concrete feedback, focusing not only on finding problems, but also on possible solutions. 
It reinforces the idea that code reviews are collaborative and aimed at improving the overall quality of the code base.
## Feedback on Practical Tasks
I would argue that code reviews are critical to improving code quality and fostering a culture of continuous learning and improvement. 
To facilitate this, I'll incorporate more frequent code review exercises into the course. 
This will not only improve the quality of individual code, but also enhance students' ability to provide and receive constructive feedback, fostering growth and collaboration within the coding community.

With this change, the actual task will provide students with a more realistic and well-rounded learning experience. 
Students will not only gain technical skills, but also develop important soft skills, such as teamwork, communication, and the ability to effectively provide and receive feedback.
